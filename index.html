			<p>Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Hi, Marty. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.</p>

			<p>No. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Doc. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick.</p>

			<p>Ah well, sort of. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. What the hell is a gigawatt?</p>
